# Puppet String

## What it does:
- Handle all the jest <-> puppeteer for you so you can start write automation script right away.
- Automatically handle start/stop app server for automation test
- Be able to mock requests from puppeteer (with customizable request matching logic)

**puppet-string** runs its own version of Jest, it could be different version of create-react-app already used.
